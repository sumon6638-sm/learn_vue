### About Vue JS
1. What is vue?
    - JavaScripot Framework
    - Interactive and Reactive
    - Web Frontends - HTML + CSS + JavaScript - Running in the browser of your user

2. Why we use vue?
    - I can build any kind of web application with just 'vanilla' JS
    - But without any framework we have to face those problem ---
        - We have to write all code on our own
        - We have to write suboptimal code or intruduce errors & bugs
        - Working in a team might be harder because not everyone knows code stucture and philosophy, because as a human all of our thingking will not be same

3. Different ways of Urilizing Vue -
    - It's can be userd to control parts of HTML pages or entire pages
        - "Widget" approach on a multi-page-application. (Some) pages are still rendered on and served by a backend server.
    - It's can also be used to control the entire frontend of a web application
        - Single Page Application(SPA) approach. Server only sends one HTML page, thereafter, Vue takes over and controls the UI.

4. Vue Alternatives -
    - React & Angular. Although vue component-based UI framework, includes most core features.
